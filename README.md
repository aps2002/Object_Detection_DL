# Object_Detection_DL
Deep learning algorithm I created at my time at the Synergy Lab at Georgia Tech. Uses OpenCV2. I am working on updating it to use OpenCV4.

Usage:

python deep_learning_object_detection.py --image images/example_01.jpg \
	--prototxt MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt.txt --model MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel

This will build the deep learning network and test it on "example_01.jpg"
